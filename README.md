# Cybersecurity Research at Robert Gordon University, UK


## Research Areas and Recent Publications

Our research focuses on the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI), which covers a wide range of topics. We explore the application of AI technologies for defensive and offensive security, and also examine the potential for AI technologies to be used for malicious and unethical purposes. Furthermore, we investigate ways to enhance the security and robustness of AI technologies. In addition to these technical aspects, we also consider the Human Factors in Security. This includes the ways in which individuals interact with technology and the social and organizational factors that can affect security. 

To make our research more accessible, we have organized our publications into categories based on their application domains. You can navigate to each of these categories using the floating menus provided, and access recent publications to stay informed on the latest developments in our research areas.
