description: Protecting computer systems, networks, software and other devices from theft, damage, or unauthorized access is important in Cybersecurity. It involves various measures and technologies such as encryption, firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection and prevention systems, access controls, vulnerability detection and others to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems. The field of cybersecurity is concerned with preventing cyber attacks, data breaches, and other security incidents, as well as responding to them in a timely and effective manner. The cybersecurity researchers at Robert Gordon University research about these aspects. ** Currently, we are accepting PhD students to carry out research projects on cybersecurity. If you have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science related field (UK equivalent 1st or 2nd upper) and a strong interest in Cyber Security, do not hesitate to contact the relavant team member.
